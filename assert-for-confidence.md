# Assert for Confidence

This assignment extends the previous assignment titled
[Infer and Report by type](type-wise-inference.md)

## Tasks

1. **Add** functionality to output 'to console'
to print a message as-it-is to the console.
(another variant of 'to controller' and 'to email')

1. Cover all of the code, if not already done.
Minimize test code and avoid repetition in tests.
Hint: If you cover all conditions of generic / abstract functionality first,
you don't need to repeat the test at a specific level.

1. Strengthen the tests. See if the tests still pass when you empty the
'check and alert' functionality - just keep the function and its return,
no implementation inside.
If your tests pass, they are not strong enough to catch errors.
Strengthen the tests.
